# MiniShell in C

**MiniShell** is a lightweight implementation of a Unix-like shell, written in C. This project demonstrates fundamental operating system concepts, such as process management, I/O redirection, pipes, and logical operators. The shell provides a command-line interface similar to traditional Unix shells.

## Key Features

### âœ… Execution of Basic Commands
- Supports standard commands such as: `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, and more.
- Handles both internal and external commands.

### âœ… I/O Redirection
- Implements output redirection (`>`).
- Input redirection (`<`) can be easily extended.

### âœ… Pipes (`|`)
- Processes commands connected through pipes, enabling the output of one command to serve as the input for the next.

### âœ… Logical Operators
- Supports basic logical operators such as `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) to execute commands conditionally.

### âœ… Process Management
- Uses `fork()`, `execve()`, and `wait()` to create and manage child processes.
